## Hello hello there!
I'm Khoa (pronounced like quoi in French) and I'm currently an incoming 4th year student at UBC, studying Finance and Business Technology Management. Not graduating any time soon though - 2026 is the time.

In my free time, I like to build things. Currently working on [UBC Courses](ubccourses.app) - a website for everything UBC courses related and [Careless Whisperer](https://github.com/andrew-fenton/careless-whisperer) - an AI text generator for personalized, casual writing.

Aside from that, I LOVE soccer and everything pokemon!

### What I have done
* Interned in Business Analytics at Capital One, where I led customer analytics projects on our co-branded card portfolios
* Interned in Customer Success at Trulioo, where I managed communications with hundreds of small business customers
* TA'd courses on Managerial Economics

### What I am up to
* Work in Product Management. During the process of building UBC Courses, I realized I really really enjoy the whole process of discovering a problem and developing a product to solve it!
* Make [UBC Courses](ubccourses.app) even better!
* Ship the MVP for Careless Whisperer, an personalized AI text generator for your unessential writings

### Find me
Feel free to reach out via my email (kbsch28@gmail.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/khoa-d-bui/) on anything really - side projects, recruiting, work advice... Always down to spark new connections!
